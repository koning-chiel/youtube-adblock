# YouTube Adblocker

This is a small Chrome extension that allows users to redirect YouTube videos to and from [yout-ube.com](https://www.yout-ube.com), a third-party site designed to watch videos without ads.

## Installation

1. Download the zip archive from the [Releases](./releases) page
2. Open Chrome and go to: [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable **Developer mode** with the button in the top-right corner
4. Unpack the zip file
5. Drag and drop the unpacked folder onto the extensions page

When the extension is installed, you can pin the puzzle icon to the toolbar, so it's always visible in Chrome.

## Usage

When you click the **blue puzzle icon** while watching a YouTube video, this extension automatically replaces the `youtube.com` part in the URL with `yout-ube.com`.

The [yout-ube.com](https://www.yout-ube.com) site then redirects you to the same video in YouTube’s no-cookie mode. In this mode ads are removed, looping is enabled and fullscreen is enabled. Click the puzzle icon again to go back to normal YouTube.

## Disclaimer

This extension is **not affiliated with or endorsed by YouTube or yout-ube.com**.
It only automates the URL redirection to and from you-tube.com.
All video content remains hosted and streamed directly from YouTube.

## Privacy Notice

This extension does not collect or store any user data. All redirection happens locally in your browser, so no data is sent to external servers by this extension.
